\f0\fs28 \cf0 Semester project - Feature to implement\
\

\fs22 One feature you can consider implementing in your Car Wash website is a user registration and profile management system. Here's how you can do it:\
\

\f1\b User Registration and Profile Management:
\f0\b0 \
\
1. 
\f1\b Registration Page:
\f0\b0  Create a new HTML page (e.g., `register.html`) that allows users to register for your service. The registration form should include fields like name, email, contact information, and a password. Ensure that the form has validation to check for valid email addresses and password complexity.\
\
2. 
\f1\b Database Integration:
\f0\b0  Implement a back-end system, such as a server (using a language like PHP, Node.js, or a web framework) and a database (e.g., MySQL or MongoDB) to store user registration information securely. When a user registers, their data is stored in the database.\
\
3. 
\f1\b User Login:
\f0\b0  Modify your existing login page (`index.html`) to include a user login form. Users should enter their email and password to access their account.\
\
4. 
\f1\b Profile Page:
\f0\b0  Create a profile page (`profile.html`) where logged-in users can view and edit their information. This page can display their name, contact details, and possibly their appointment history.\
\
5. 
\f1\b Authentication:
\f0\b0  Implement a user authentication system to verify user credentials during login. You can use techniques like session management or JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.\
\
6. 
\f1\b User-Friendly Feedback:
\f0\b0  Provide informative feedback to users during the registration and login processes. For example, inform them if their registration was successful or if their login credentials are incorrect.\
\
7. 
\f1\b Security:
\f0\b0  Ensure that user passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database to protect user data.\
\
8. 
\f1\b Password Reset:
\f0\b0  Implement a "Forgot Password" feature that allows users to reset their passwords via email.\
\
9. 
\f1\b Privacy and Data Protection: 
\f0\b0 Create a privacy policy and terms of service to explain how user data is handled and protected.\
\
10. 
\f1\b Appointment Integration:
\f0\b0  Integrate user profiles with the appointment system so that users can view and manage their appointments after logging in.\
\
11. 
\f1\b Email Notifications:
\f0\b0  Send email notifications to users for account verification, appointment confirmations, and password resets.\
\
12. 
\f1\b Responsive Design:
\f0\b0  Ensure that the registration, login, and profile pages are designed to be mobile-friendly for users on various devices.\
\
Implementing user registration and profile management will enhance the user experience by allowing users to personalize their Car Wash service, track their appointments, and receive important notifications. It also opens up possibilities for future features like loyalty programs or personalized offers.}
